                                  INSTALLATION

Just type "./waf configure --prefix=${HOME}", followed by "./waf install".
This will install all the necessary files in your home directory.
Other directories can be specified with the prefix option, for example,
"./waf configure --prefix=/usr".

If you are using Ubuntu or you want to install mono-style icons for the
ubuntu-mono themes, run waf configure with the ubuntu-icons flag like this:
"./waf configure --ubuntu-icons".
